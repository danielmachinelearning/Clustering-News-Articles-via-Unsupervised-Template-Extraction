kailee lingo her sorority sister at tarleton state university in stephenville texas kailee remembers that when she and cade met it was a connection at first sight a month after college graduation kailee and cade married in marble falls texas they re both proud to be native texans kailee s family has lived there for generations and cade s ancestors are among texas old three hundred the original families that joined stephen f austin to settle the area in the s at the time the despains were both passionately anti abortion abortion is banned or severely limited in a number of states here s where things stand i was just your quintessential pro life texan kailee told cnn in a recent interview read more i was raised in central texas by extremely republican parents and grandparents cade said one hundred percent pro life kailee and cade have supported abortion rights since when she had a miscarriage at weeks and was hospitalized for severe complications including blood clots and infection it was one of three miscarriages she had in the early years of marriage it made me realize that pregnancy can be dangerous she said it made me think of my little sisters and i wanted them to be able to have a choice if they ever had to go through something like that last september when a restrictive anti abortion law took effect in texas kailee pleaded on facebook for people to contact their elected representatives to protect abortion rights new mexico governor directs million for new abortion clinic near texas border in november kailee and cade were overjoyed to learn that she was pregnant full of hope they posted ultrasound pictures and a gender reveal video of a cannon shooting out blue confetti they named their baby boy finley then about three months later they learned that finley had heart lung brain kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth carrying him to term put kailee at high risk for severe pregnancy complications including blood clots preeclampsia and cancer even so they could not get an abortion in texas and fled to new mexico i ve never felt more betrayed by a place i was once so proud to be from kailee said through tears how could you be so cruel as to pass a law that you know will hurt women and that you know will cause babies to be born in pain she added how is that humane how is that saving anybody cnn emailed texas lawmakers who authored or sponsored the state s anti abortion laws none of them responded to cnn s questions a grim prognosis for their baby when kailee and cade found out she was pregnant they desperately hoped for a sticky baby a pregnancy that would stick after her three miscarriages department of veterans affairs to offer abortion counseling and certain abortions to veterans but after multiple ultrasounds the doctors prognosis was grim his heart lung kidney and brain problems were severe and his genetic disorder called triploidy meant he had an extra set of chromosomes the doctors said that either finley would die before birth or if he did make it to term he would die a few minutes or at most an hour after birth one of their doctors told them some of these things could be fixed but all of these things together this cannot be fixed kailee remembers she says the doctor told them that before texas six week abortion ban went into effect in september of last year she would have advised abortion as the safest course for you and the most humane course of action for him but the doctor said she could not offer them an abortion in texas she said the only option to get one was to travel out of state risk to kailee s life staying pregnant with finley could have put kailee s life in danger she has two blood clotting disorders which put her at a higher risk for having dangerous blood clots during pregnancy plus mothers of babies with triploidy are more likely to get preeclampsia a potentially deadly pregnancy disorder also there was an increased risk for a placental abnormality associated with cancer kailee said she considered risking her own life to carry finley to term i wanted to say goodbye she said i wanted a chance to hold him but then she thought about how finley would suffer as he struggled to breathe michigan supreme court orders abortion rights initiative to appear on november ballot he s going to suffocate he s going to die and i m going to watch him do it she said for cade there was only one option it made no sense to him to risk his wife s life to have a baby who was certain to die quickly cade told kailee i will support you whatever decision that you make but i really don t want to lose both of you kailee remembers the couple opted for abortion driving hours to a clinic in new mexico the procedure and travel cost they hoped their insurance would cover the procedure but texas law strictly limits abortion coverage and the clinic told them their insurance company declined to pay the despains didn t have enough money kailee said she was docked pay at work because she d had too many sick days so cade asked a relative he describes as the epitome of the trump fanboy to give them the the relative relented when cade said that without the abortion he could end up a widower at age cade said he didn t like asking for the money but my job as a husband is to protect and love my wife if i m not fighting to keep her here then i failed kailee had the abortion in march when she was weeks pregnant i m still so angry and hurt while legislators did not respond to cnn s questions about kailee s case the president of texas right to life did john seago said that texas law is very clear about what circumstances that an abortion could be performed and that what happened to kailee and the response of her physicians was absolutely a misrepresentation of the law and this should never have happened in some states doctors weigh ruinous litigation against proper care for women who have miscarriages but katie keith director of the health policy and the law initiative at georgetown university law center said texas abortion laws the one that took effect last year and another one that went into effect last month are not at all clear and are designed to be purposely vague and broad the more recent law for example says an abortion can be performed if the mother has a life threatening physical condition aggravated caused by or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function they don t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided keith said kailee said her doctors told her they could give her an abortion only if she were at imminent risk of dying essentially if she were dying on the table if a physician is found in violation of the law the punishments can be severe heavy fines loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison plus citizens can file lawsuits against physicians they think have performed an illegal abortion and if they win they can get a reward if the citizen is wrong and the doctor wins the lawsuit the doctor still has to pay their own legal fees as texas law specifically forbids doctors from recouping fees from plaintiffs an illinois oasis opens a window onto america in a post roe v wade era facing the potential to become a felon and face life in prison for simply trying to take care of patients has been horrifying and i d be lying if i said that i haven t considered leaving the state said dr leah tatum a spokesperson for the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists who practices in austin texas and has treated patients in similar situations to kailee s since the texas anti abortion laws passed the texas law that went into effect last year barred most abortions at the onset of fetal cardiac activity which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many people know they are pregnant it was one of the earliest and most restrictive abortion laws laws that ban abortion or severely restrict the procedure have gone into effect in about a dozen states after the us supreme court ended a constitutional right to abortion on june kailee says that the last time she saw her obstetrician she advised her not to get pregnant in texas she said this is not safe kailee remembers she said i need you to look at me i need you to understand that if you get pregnant in texas and that if you have complications that i cannot intervene until i can prove that you re going to die get

difficult to leave their work and their families kailee said they re sharing their story in hopes of increasing awareness so that stories like mine can change enough voters perspectives i m still so angry and hurt about it that i can hardly see straight she wrote on facebook the day after the abortion finley and i were simply collateral damage in a much bigger picture it s hard for me to wrap my

offshoot the latest furry target of ted cruz s ire vaccines for children under a turning point for many us families cdc close to decision on covid vaccine for younger kids are you gonna let me answer a question fauci and paul face off in tense exchange cnn covid cases are on the rise among kids in the united states as another school year gets underway new cases reported among children in the last week of august were higher than they were two weeks earlier according to data tracked by the american academy of pediatrics they jumped even more in the south where classes have been in session for weeks in contrast overall cases for all ages were down about in the same timeframe experts say that this increased transmission is to be expected but that keeping kids in school should be the priority and there are now enough ways to make sure it s done safely we do see infectious diseases spread every time the school year starts that s been a phenomenon well known long before covid said dr sean o leary chair of the pediatric association s committee on infectious diseases the good news is we re in a much different place with this pandemic than we were two years ago or even last year in terms of the percentage of the population that s vaccinated americans may need yearly shots to protect against covid eligibility for covid vaccines was expanded to include ages to in november making this the first full school year in which all school age children could have their initial series read more still vaccination rates for children lag and have changed little recently about of children ages to and just of children to have their initial series compared with about of adults according to data from the us centers for disease control and prevention children and up are also eligible for a booster shot but only those and up can get the updated version and so far only about of children ages to have gotten a booster the slow rollout of vaccines for children is part of why pediatric cases became more prevalent during last school year said dr grace lee pediatrics professor at stanford university school of medicine and chair of the cdc s vaccine advisory committee in there wasn t much virus circulating among children because most were learning from home she said but the negative effects of remote learning were coming into focus an assessment conducted by the national center for education statistics found that test scores among year olds plummeted in math and reading after the pandemic and mental health related visits to emergency rooms among adolescents saw a steep increase we needed the kids to go back in person for learning at the same time we didn t have as many opportunities to offer vaccination in a timely manner to those who were going back to school so that is really challenging lee said part of the reason we saw case rates jump up in pediatrics is because they were the last population to get vaccinated now though there s greater population immunity built up through a combination of vaccination and infection student test scores plummeted in math and reading after the pandemic new assessment finds about out of children in the us have had covid at some point according to estimates from the cdc that are based on the presence of antibodies in blood samples this is a significant jump from the end of when of children were estimated to have had covid that doesn t mean the potential for covid to spread in schools should be ignored experts say it was still a top cause of death for children last year and there s too much uncertainty about what s to come we ve now been infected vaccinated infected vaccinated where are we going this season i do think that we have to take it one year one month at a time lee said last year the cdc updated its school guidance to prioritize in person learning while maintaining layered prevention strategies such as masking physical distancing and vaccinations for those who were eligible last month the guidance was updated again dropping recommendations for programs that require a negative test to stay in the classroom or restrict kids to one classroom or cohort mask mandates have dropped across the county too however while the cdc and others are more generally focused on preventing severe disease from covid experts say there are still benefits to avoiding infection especially for kids in school we have to really take a life course approach with children lee said thinking about both the short and long term effects in the short term a covid infection completely disrupts your family life and your school life and your personal life she said every time someone gets sick whether it s covid or flu or anything else they re getting further and further behind she said and the burden of infection is not equitable causing disparities to grow children can have long covid too a direct long term risk of infection and if enough teachers get sick the indirect risks from the early days of school closures can resurface get cnn health s weekly newsletter sign up here to get the results are in with dr sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team as a parent herself lee recommends that kids continue to wear masks in schools and keep up to date with any vaccines they re eligible for i would say kids have been the most adaptable during the pandemic so i m less worried about that piece of it lee said my hope is that we make schools a safe and equitable place to continue to learn and that we support our children no matter what happens search audio us crime justice energy environment

food and drug administration s authorization these shots will replace the boosters previously offered in the us such that for people and older being up to date with vaccines means having the new jab is the covid vaccine going to become an annual shot like the flu vaccine speaking tuesday head of the biden administration s covid response team dr ashish jha suggested so telling reporters that the vaccines and boosters are likely to become a more routine part of our lives pfizer updated covid vaccine pfizer everything you need to know about the updated covid boosters a lot of people have specific questions about whether they should get it now or wait who should rush out and get the booster and who can probably wait a little longer is there a benefit to delaying the vaccine so that it can be timed with winter holidays and should parents of kids under worry that they aren t yet eligible to guide us through these questions i spoke with cnn medical analyst dr leana wen an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the george washington university milken institute school of public health she is also author of lifelines a doctor s journey in the fight for public health cnn what are your major takeaways about the updated booster dr leana wen one takeaway is that the booster will be an updated formulation that targets both the original strain and the omicron subvariants this is not unusual it s what s done every year for the flu vaccine where manufacturers anticipate what will likely be the strains in circulation and then target the vaccine accordingly another important takeaway for me is that the cdc is moving away from counting the number of vaccine doses and instead saying that people and older are considered up to date on their coronavirus vaccines if they have received the original primary series two doses of pfizer two doses of moderna or one dose of johnson johnson plus this updated booster that simplifies things a lot cnn do you think the coronavirus vaccine is going to be an annual shot similar to the influenza vaccine wen from the time covid vaccines were first authorized i and other public health experts have been saying this would be a possibility we didn t know whether the coronavirus vaccines would be a series of two three or four shots after which you re done or whether it would need to be given on regular intervals the hepatitis vaccine for example is a three dose vaccine versus the tetanus vaccine which requires regular boosters and of course the flu vaccine is updated every year if you have not been vaccinated in and have not had a recent infection i d advise that you get the booster sooner rather than later says dr leana wen emily elconin reuters it s looking like the coronavirus vaccines are more like the flu vaccine immunity wanes after a time and there are also new strains that may benefit from more targeted vaccines federal health authorities have even signaled they may shift to an annual cadence such cadence will be helpful i think because americans are already used to getting a flu shot every year especially if the covid booster can be timed together with the flu shot that could help improve vaccine uptake for both shots cnn friends and colleagues all have some version of this question should they get the new booster now in your opinion who should rush out and get the booster as soon as it s available wen the cdc says that everyone and older is recommended to get the updated booster as long as it s been at least two months since their last vaccine to me though that doesn t mean that the urgency is the same for everyone i think it s most urgent for people who have not received any vaccine or not had covid in to get the updated booster this is especially true for older individuals and those who have chronic medical conditions about of people and older have not had any booster those individuals really should get the updated booster now commuters walk through the times square subway station in new york us on thursday june the head of new york s metropolitan transportation authority warned the agency s anticipated billion budget gap may widen in as it struggles to win back riders jeenah moon bloomberg getty images expert explains how to protect yourself against the recent covid surges until this latest cdc announcement only individuals and older and those who are immunocompromised have been able to get two boosters the uptake for that second booster has also been low with only about uptake so far among individuals and older that means there are quite a few adults who have may have had their last shot in the previous calendar year i d advise these individuals not to wait if someone has not gotten any vaccine they need to get vaccinated with the primary series first that means getting the two doses of the original pfizer or moderna vaccines or two doses of novavax or one dose of johnson johnson people need to complete the primary series prior to receiving the updated booster cnn who would you say could wait a little to get the updated booster wen people who recently recovered from covid can wait to get the updated booster cdc guidelines say that these individuals could wait three months from their infection i think this is sound advice reinfection is unlikely immediately after recovery and also there could be benefit to allowing the body time to produce antibodies from infection the cdc also says that people are eligible to be vaccinated with the new booster if it s been at least two months since their last vaccine i don t think most people need to rush out to get the booster exactly at the two month mark some might decide to wait three or four months so that it s a little bit later in the fall that way they could have better protection around the holidays cnn i ve been hearing from some people like you said who want to time the booster around winter holidays does that make sense to you wen i can understand why they d want to do this we know that the covid shots provide maximal effectiveness against infection in the several weeks after they re given there is sustained protection against severe illness but the effectiveness against infection wanes somewhat over time a pharmacist handles a syringe for the flu vaccine in the consultation room at his dispensary on october in downtown bordeaux south western france for the first time in france in the regions of new aquitaine and auvergne rh ne alpes of pharmacists have been allowed to administer the flu vaccination afp photo georges gobet photo credit should read georges gobet afp via getty images georges gobet afp afp via getty images australia s tough flu season could spell trouble for the us this winter especially with covid in the mix it s hard to predict the best timing the shots though because we don t know what will happen this fall and winter right now the case count for covid is high in a lot of parts of the country for some people especially those who are more vulnerable to severe illness it makes sense to get optimal protection now but case counts could also increase later this fall and some others may decide to wait until a few weeks before thanksgiving to get their booster in general i d go back to the point of last vaccine or infection if you have not been vaccinated in and have not had a recent infection i d advise that you get the booster sooner rather than later but if you recently had a booster and or covid you could probably wait a month or so to try to have more effectiveness against infection going into holidays cnn should parents of kids under worry that they aren t eligible yet for the update booster wen no and i don t think the case for boosting children is nearly as clear as it is for adults the majority of children have had covid recovery from infection plus vaccination affords them a very high level of protection against severe illness i think it s

brenda goodman cnn updated pm et wed september just watched fda approves drug to help protect the immunocompromised from covid replay more videos must watch fda approves drug to help protect the immunocompromised from covid cnn the antibodies in evusheld the only therapy available to protect people with reduced immune function against covid may lose their punch against the ba subvariant a new study shows ba is an offshoot of the ba subvariant of the omicron coronavirus variant only a couple of mutations separate it from its predecessor but it is slowly gaining ground in the united states even against ba which continues to dominate transmission patients charged hundreds of dollars to get covid drugs already paid for by taxpayers ba is now causing an estimated to of new covid infections according to data from the us centers for disease control and prevention it is particularly prevalent in the midwest where it is causing an estimated of new infections evusheld is a combination of two long lasting lab created antibodies made by astrazeneca when given every six months it can prevent a covid infection in people who may not get enough protection from vaccines because their immune system can t respond effectively to them the cdc estimates that about million americans could benefit from the protection of evusheld this vital therapy has been holding up well against new coronavirus variants but in new tests dr david ho a professor of microbiology and immunology at columbia university found that although this subvariant doesn t seem to bind to our cells more easily than others it does appear to evade the ability of some antibodies to neutralize it including those in evusheld opinion there s a drug to protect the most vulnerable from covid why is it so hard to get read more we found that that combination antibody no longer works against this new variant and that is the only antibody combination that s approved for prevention of covid ho told cnn ho and his team have worked throughout the pandemic to quickly characterize new variants to help the us refine its treatment strategy his latest research has been shared as a preprint in advance of peer review ho said he has also sent his results to the national institutes of health and the us food and drug administration the fda said in a statement that it is working with sponsors of all currently authorized therapeutics to assess the activity against any global sars cov variant s of interest and is committed to communicating with the public as we learn more everything you need to know about the updated covid boosters astrazeneca said that the antibodies in evusheld work together and that testing them separately may not reflect how the therapy performs in the real world there is limited relevance to studies that evaluate the evusheld component antibodies individually vs in combination or that attempt to recreate versions of tixagevimab and cilgavimab vs authentic evusheld the data for the individual evusheld antibodies are not representative of the synergistic effect of the combination as administered in the evusheld label antibodies recreated in a laboratory based on publicly available information are not an accurate replication of evusheld a spokesperson said in a statement ho says that he did test the combination of the antibodies and that he s confident in his results he points out that his team s conclusions echo the results of similar tests performed by scientists in china in the meantime ho says people who are immunocompromised need to know that evusheld may not be as protective as it once was get cnn health s weekly newsletter sign up here to get the results are in with dr sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team just be aware that ba is going to be resistant and it is gaining ground on ba so folks who are immunocompromised in general should be more cautious he said ho says that based on his research only one monoclonal antibody bebtelovimab continues to be effective against the circulating variants now we ll be left essentially with one antibody he says everything else is gone he said the fda has been very focused on making sure the covid vaccines are updated but he worries that it hasn t continued to keep antibody treatments current there are millions of people who have compromises to the immune system and they would be running

jeremy swift brett goldstein jason sudeikis brendan hunt and nick mohammed in season of ted lasso cnn succession the emmy winner for best drama series will be a top contender at this year s ceremony on sept but if you re wondering whether the hbo drama can beat last year s champion netflix s the crown that matchup of tv s royal houses will have to wait once upon a time hit series dutifully premiered each fall meaning you could count on dramas like hill street blues and er or sitcoms like cheers and then frasier to be in contention every year during their long runs now however prestige series tend to operate on their own timetables skipping years or longer between seasons throw in the pandemic that disrupted production schedules and viewers are to be forgiven if they can t keep track of what s eligible from year to year even with a scorecard take barry and atlanta both entered as comedies which after their extended layoffs return to the awards fray the former in multiple categories the latter for star donald glover for the first time since and respectively among the best drama nominees the aforementioned succession stranger things euphoria better call saul and ozark

arguably stiffer competition this year includes new players abbott elementary and only murders in the building along with four series that weren t on the menu barry the marvelous mrs maisel what we do in the shadows and curb your enthusiasm curb is in something of a trailblazing class by itself spreading seasons and emmy nominations over the last years certain shows require a separate asterisk due

both stranger things and better call saul split their seasons with the first halves falling within that timeframe while the latter didn t meaning they ll be eligible again in the emmy calendar can also foster confusion depending on when series premiere if for example you just finished watching the second season of hulu s only murders in the building remember it s the first season that s nominated this year limited series avoid questions of repetition but not timing it s again a loaded lineup featuring hulu s dopesick the dropout and pam tommy netflix s inventing anna and hbo s the white lotus the only one not based on a true story even there the vagaries of the emmy calendar and rules play a part take the star wars prequel obi wan kenobi which actually premiered just before may deadline but declined to make subsequent episodes available in advance to voters delaying its consideration until star ewan mcgregor won his first emmy last year for another limited series netflix s halston the main televised emmys annually follow what are known as the creative arts awards which were presented sept in dozens of mostly technical categories for those keeping score or who simply enjoy questions about network bragging rights hbo and hbo max totaled awards followed by netflix with and the streaming services disney hulu and amazon prime netflix tied a year old record with total statuettes last year from all those ceremonies more than twice nearest competitor hbo which had led the way in and after tying with netflix in stranger things euphoria and the white lotus each collected five awards last weekend and could add to those totals sept as did the special adele one night only and the docuseries the beatles get back succession which garnered nine emmys in has thus

twang but never takes flight review by brian lowry cnn published am edt sun september link copied ad feedback susan sarandon and trace adkins play country stars in the fox series monarch fox cnn if ever a show had its elevator pitch written on its sleeve it s fox s monarch which was pretty transparently sold as empire but with country music that backdrop opens up obvious possibilities starting with a list of country cameos but it can t make this family drama take flight or feel any fresher than another iteration of a she done me wrong song just to sum up the familiar tune on display monarch which after an eight month delay will be introduced after fox s nfl coverage before shifting to its regular monday time slot begins with a flash forward that involves a dead body and a flashback showing an arson fire and that s all in the first three minutes still the hits keep on coming as the show goes about illustrating the fractious relationships holding together the first family of country music the romans with matriarch dottie susan sarandon and her hubby albie trace adkins both established stars while daughter nicky pushing daisies anna friel yearns for a level of stardom that has thus far eluded her i ve been preparing for this moment my entire life nicky says when presented an opportunity to shine but of course that comes amid a family crisis that also opens up issues for her sister gigi beth ditto who has stayed outside the spotlight and brother luke joshua sasse who essentially runs the family s business interests created by screenwriter melissa london hilfers monarch contains the usual family feuds and secrets teasing out the latter how to get away with murder style by counting down toward revealing what happened when the story began yet it s all steeped in overly familiar soap opera flourishes to the point where when one of the characters tries to halt a possible sexual encounter by saying this is wrong that s a pretty sure fire clue that they re going to go ahead and do it anyway indeed there are so many country cliches the biggest shock might be that there isn t drama built around a rodeo sequence until the fourth episode as noted the setting creates the opportunity for the likes of shania twain to pop in during the early episodes martina mcbride and tanya tucker will show up later and for sarandon to play the imperious queen of country that said sarandon fills a relatively modest role and even in the ensemble context it s primarily friel s show with adkins delivering most of his lines in a cranky bear like growl as a footnote sarandon s daughter eva amurri appears as dottie in the flashbacks reflecting that this is a family affair in more ways than one as the premise makes clear monarch doesn t intent to reinvent the wheel but rather simply to wrap the rich family soap template in a slightly different package garnished with an assortment of country standards sequins and cowboy hats a country craving crowd might be ready for that rather slim wrinkle with the understanding that when it comes to serialized dramas built around family dynasties monarch won t be anybody s first rodeo monarch premieres

is part of cnn style s ongoing project the september issues a thought provoking hub for conversations about fashion s impact on people and the planet fashion is barreling towards a digital future in this brave new world a cherished paycheck might no longer be spent on a scrupulously researched pair of christian louboutins or a long envied dior saddle bag but a collection of pixels depicting these accessories the brands breaking into digital fashion believe virtual clothes will become increasingly important as we spend more of our lives online and that s not just in familiar spaces such as dating apps video games and zoom but in the metaverse and beyond luxury fashion houses are funneling millions into the metaverse but to what end i went to fashion week in the metaverse just as in the real world virtual dressing can make an impression a d fashion filter dressing you in the latest dior digital jacket might for example give you the confidence to nail your next remote interview fashion isn t here just to keep us warm said elliott young co founder of the institute of digital fashion a think tank and digital fashion consultancy that advises luxury clients on how to engage in virtual fashion it s about expression creative community being within your tribe for those looking to get involved in this rapidly emerging and often confusing space here are a few ways you can expand your virtual wardrobe the institute of digital fashion collaborated with la based couture house august getty atelier to create a piece of digital couture credit institue of digital fashion where do i shop you can shop for virtual clothes on e commerce platforms like dressx the world s largest digital fashion retailer replicant the dematerialised and digitallax where you can scroll through products just as you might when shopping for physical pieces online dressx has more than items from digital crop tops and sneakers to larger than life sculptural dresses futuristic gowns fit for royalty or coats caught on fire you can try on a selection of dressx s repertoire on the app which uses augmented reality to create a digital overlay that adds to or augments live camera footage some luxury brands such as karl lagerfeld rebecca minkoff and rotate are housed on the dematerialised while others like gucci are now available on the video game roblox dressx also has a store in the browser based metaverse decentraland in decentraland unveiled metajuku a square foot virtual shopping destination inspired by tokyo s famously stylish neighborhood harajuku you can peruse well design stores in this immersive albeit low resolution digital realm players aren t able to try on pieces in this metaverse yet but they can see suspended degree versions of the clothes clicking on an item will take you to a browser only purchase page outside of the platform karlie kloss fashion designers in the future won t just be sewing they ll be coding as for video games where users have long embraced digital fashion buying avatar skins differs depending on your gaming preferences in animal crossing new horizons on nintendo switch players can get hold of special collections by marc jacobs valentino and maison margiela via free download codes posted on the animal crossing fashion archive instagram account animalcrossingfashionarchive in roblox and fortnite players will need to purchase their garments through official in game catalogs called avatar shop or item shop in june the sims collaborated with resale platform and gen z favorite depop to create a range of y k inspired digital outfits from corset tops to flared jeans and graffiti jackets these special outfits are only available in the high school years extension pack an add on that costs around on top of the sims base game for either pc xbox or playstation dressx has a virtual store in metajuku an immersive shopping district in the metaverse decentraland credit decentraland what am i actually buying digital fashion exists in several forms the first being a wearable version of an nft or non fungible token unlike the digital art market where nfts exist only as collectible images many digital fashion designers now include a wearable version in the sale of an nft meaning buyers can show off their purchase in photographs in the metaverse or through ar filters which enable digital garments to move with your body in real time for example it bag of the metaverse an nft of a glittering circle bag that comes in purple silver gold and blue by digital designer diverge is a fully wearable virtual accessory your it bag nft can be superimposed as a d render onto your irl photos and videos desktop livestreams using a unique ar filter or worn by your avatar in decentraland skins are another configuration of digital fashion used to personalize your avatar in video games in fortnite collaborated with balenciaga to release a range of gaming skins specially designed for fortnite avatars the it bag of the metaverse wearable nft designed by diverge can be seen here as a d render photoshopped onto a customer s image credit diverge how do i pay do i need cryptocurrency a piece of digital fashion can range in price anywhere from per outfit to thousands typically items will cost around per garment depending on the brand and level of detail much like items in the real world purchasing digital garments in the metaverse often requires a digital currency decentraland accepts ethereum and mana the official crypto created by the metaverse providers you can buy both on crypto trading platforms such as etoro and coinbase to get full access to the decentraland metaverse you will need to set up a digital crypto wallet there are several different wallet providers metamask fortmatic walletconnect and coinbase a digital crypto wallet is a way of managing your funds while keeping everything secure through a series of private passwords dressx has more than virtual garments for sale on its website credit dressx but if you re intimidated by trading apps you can now buy crypto directly on paypal the app is selling bitcoin and ethereum directly to account holders via its website and smartphone app some digital fashion marketplaces allow payment in traditional currency too it s a real pain point it s like setting up a bank account said elliott young but i think we re starting to see a smoother route with a balance as technology improves and we ll be using pounds or currency beyond crypto as well for garments on dressx replicant and auroboros you can purchase in us dollars in roblox the native currency robux can be purchased with a debit or credit card by navigating to the buy robux page in game similarly users can buy fortnite v bucks when playing and selecting the buy v bucks menu where do i wear my new digital wardrobe and how are my garments stored a pillar of the digital fashion movement is the concept of decentralization instead of the usual hierarchy of legacy brands creatives with programming skills can technically build their own digital fashion label at a relatively low cost but the downside of this creative freedom is the messy disjointed process of buying and storing your digital outfits digital fashion players including the institute of digital fashion are already working to simplify this experience for the upcoming london fashion week elliott young hopes to launch a one stop members only metaverse where you can browse buy and wear digital pieces from a range of designers it is quite scattergun in terms of where you can wear your pieces and where you can shop but we re seeing more and more now that you can use the items in multiple metaverses and in augmented reality similarly dressx is already supported in decentraland and will soon be available in mark zuckerberg s metaverse designers spend a painstaking amount of time building digital couture from building each bead to making sure the jewels reflect the light realistically credit institute of digital fashion outside of the metaverse and video games digital fashion can be worn in photos through a custom made d render in smartphone videos or even livestreams checkout pages for digital fashion will include an upload tab where you can submit several photos or videos of yourself and the brand will photoshop the garment onto your body post these where you d normally post a selfie for live video chats digital fashion filters are available through snapchat s snaplens downloadable desktop application which is compatible with zoom google hangouts and skype digital dress codes what will we wear in the metaverse these photos or videos then become your item and you can store them the way you would store any photo in your camera roll or on a hard drive gaming skins remain in the video game you

just be sewing they ll be coding written by karlie kloss karlie kloss is an american supermodel and entrepreneur she founded kode with klossy in to empower more young girls and nonbinary youth with skills in tech all opinions expressed in this article belong to the author this story is part of cnn style s ongoing project the september issues a thought provoking hub for conversations about fashion s impact on people and the planet growing up in the midwest my dad an er physician instilled in me and my sisters a love for science tech and math but more than that he taught me to always be curious my modeling career kicked off when i was only but i have strived to be a student of the world even as my path became nontraditional nearly seven years into my career i decided to take a coding class learning ruby html and css i was intrigued by the language that powers our everyday lives so ubiquitous and yet so unknown style guide how to dress in digital fashion that coding class changed the trajectory of my career and sparked a lifelong passion for how technology can be used creatively to solve real problems transform lives and address our world s biggest challenges but i noticed one thing the people creating this technology were overwhelmingly men i knew it was incredibly important to have diversity at the table of those building the tech that powers our everyday what kind of life changing apps or global solutions would we have at our fingertips if more underrepresented groups were encouraged to pursue their stem science technology engineering and math interests and supported in those endeavors from a young age the next spring i offered to send a few girls to the same class i took through a post on my youtube channel and instagram the response was overwhelming and i received thousands of applications this led me to found kode with klossy in which runs free summer camp sessions that teach young women and nonbinary youth the fundamentals of coding karlie kloss began her own coding program kode with klossy after taking a coding class that changed the course of her career credit courtesy of kode with klossy the scholars who have attended over the years have amazed me with their ingenuity in developing projects with an impact one group built an app that utilizes machine learning technology to teach people how to correctly recycle everyday items and another created a social network that connects women and other gender minorities who want to pursue careers in tech to date kode with klossy has educated over scholars who prove year after year that given the right tools young people can build the world they want to see while modeling is still my day job spending most of the past decade working in both fashion and tech has helped me conceptualize how digital technology can help solve some of the biggest issues in fashion for example tech is already opening up so many opportunities to expand creative expression and design it can also help address some of the industry s biggest challenges from its role in the climate crisis to the lack of size inclusivity i believe that designers in the future won t just be sewing they ll be coding community innovation over the past few years fashion has been booming with technological innovations digital designers for example are using d modeling and ar to outfit avatars and humans alike the potential to change how fashion is made sustained and accessed is limitless and it s been amazing to collaborate with the creatives building on this innovative front a few years ago i launched a new line with adidas and we collaborated with digital fashion house the fabricant to design a virtual version of a jacket from the collection then we made that digital garment available for artists to create their own interpretations so many people put their unique spin on the garments and the top entries were auctioned off as nfts the earnings were split equally between the creators and kode with klossy this summer i worked with the immersive gaming platform roblox and its talented creator community to host a digital pop up shop called fashion klossette designer showcase digital fashion designers in the community were invited to create and showcase their avatars outfits which drew in two million unique players in just two weeks sales of the virtual garments from the shop went directly to the creators affirming the value of their creativity kloss worked with roblox s creator community to launch a pop up shop earlier this summer to showcase digital fashion talent drawing millions of visitors credit yourius roblox these young designers are already revolutionizing how people express themselves online dressing millions of roblox community members who are updating their avatars daily creators i worked with for the fashion klossette designer showcase come from a variety of backgrounds and are building their personal brands collections and careers some have already been approached by top fashion brands on collaborations their creativity is enabled by new digital spaces technology and tools that allow for easy access from anywhere uninhibited by financial and other physical world limitations my goal is to help further bridge the gap between them and the established fashion industry this first experience was just the beginning of what we are building on roblox and i m excited for all that s ahead their creativity is enabled by new digital spaces technology and tools that allow for easy access from anywhere uninhibited by financial and other physical world limitations kloss said credit lovespun roblox a need for sustainable solutions boundary pushing talent and innovative ideas will always be a few of my favorite things about the fashion industry but there is still a lot to be desired in terms of sustainability and inclusivity physical fashion produces a lot of waste and is one of world s largest polluters digital technology is going to be the best weapon to help combat this and make the fashion industry more sustainable advanced tech such as ai ar d modeling and rfid tagging are already creating efficient tools that reduce the industry s carbon footprint and environmental pollution take bods for example it s a virtual fit tool that uses a digital duplicate of a shopper s body to help them find the right size before they order clothes online i decided to invest in the company because these types of innovations mitigate one of the industry s fast growing problem with returned merchandise which often ends up in landfills even if they are still wearable the inherent uncertainty involved in online shopping also results in an obscene surplus of inventory that never actually reaches the people who want or need it cher horowitz s virtual closet in the movie clueless might be one of the best blueprints for digitized fashion it has been a source of inspiration for my own closet and many kode with klossy scholars whether they were creating apps to specifically showcase fashion looks and trends or translating the layout to visually present information in a fun and simple way today new innovations like digitally tracking physical garments once they leave the store has even bigger implications using embedded rfid tags can aid in moving fashion towards a circular design model eon a company i ve also invested in provides environmental impact reports in real time using this technology as garments move through their life cycles eon gives brands accurate data on their impact and gives consumers transparency about each item in their closet information that is usually hard to find and decipher like how garments are made and how they can potentially be recycled is at everyone s fingertips with this technology resellers will be able to weed out counterfeit garments and determine better pricing for authentic used items creating a more sound and credible secondhand market but fashion needs more people with the skills to make these lofty goals standard practice a path forward young women and gender nonconforming people have historically faced higher barriers to becoming software programmers or engineers it s rare that stem fields are presented as a realistic path for young girls i was confident and curious enough to step into this industry but only as an adult with a successful career already secured many marginalized groups do not have that privilege which is why i m so passionate about equipping them with these skills and providing access to opportunities this year we wrapped our th summer of kode with klossy camps with young female and gender nonconforming coders from different countries participating i ve seen our scholars recognize their own power and potential that kind of self actualization pays dividends even beyond a career path the diversity some of them will bring to the workforce can change fashion and the world as told to cnn s jacqui palumbo search us crime justice
